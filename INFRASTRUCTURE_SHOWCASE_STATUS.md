## üìã Implementation Guide

### For Cloud Engineering Skill

**Pattern:** Follow the release-engineering template structure:

```markdown
# Cloud Engineering

[Overview section with purpose, scope, when to use]

## Quick Start Checklist
- [ ] Choose cloud provider(s)
- [ ] Design network architecture
- [ ] Plan IAM strategy
- [ ] etc.

## Core Concepts
[Key concepts with diagrams]

## Common Patterns
[3-4 common patterns with code examples]

## Resource Files
[Links to all 10 resources]

## Best Practices
[Production-tested best practices]

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
[Common mistakes]

## Common Tasks
[Step-by-step task guides]

## Integration Points
[How it connects to other skills]
```

**Each resource file should include:**
- Table of Contents
- Overview
- Comprehensive examples
- Best practices
- Anti-patterns
- Related resources links

### For Systems Engineering Skill

Same pattern as cloud-engineering and release-engineering.

### For Agents

Follow the pattern from kubernetes-specialist.md:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description (use for X, Y, Z)
model: sonnet
color: [blue|green|purple|red|yellow]
---

You are an expert at [domain]...

## Your Role
[What this agent does]

## Approach
[How the agent works]

## Best Practices to Enforce
‚úÖ [Do this]
‚ùå [Don't do this]

[Closing statement about quality]
```

### For Slash Commands

Follow the pattern from infra-plan.md:

```yaml
---
description: Brief description
argument-hint: Example of what user should provide
---

[Command description and purpose]

## Instructions
[Detailed step-by-step instructions]

## Output Format
[Expected output structure]

[Quality requirements]
```

### For Hooks

Follow the pattern from terraform-validator.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description
# What it validates

set -e

# Validation logic
# Use available tools (terraform, kubectl, etc.)
# Exit 0 on success, exit 1 on failure
# Provide helpful error messages
```

## üéØ Quality Standards

All files should meet these criteria:

1. **Production-Ready:** Real examples that actually work
2. **Comprehensive:** Cover the topic thoroughly (but < 500 lines per file)
3. **Well-Structured:** Clear sections, good formatting
4. **Practical:** Include copy-pasteable code examples
5. **Cross-Referenced:** Link to related resources
6. **Best Practices:** Include both what to do and what to avoid
7. **Maintainable:** Easy to update as technologies evolve
