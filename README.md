# Claude Code Infrastructure Showcase

**A curated reference library of production-tested Claude Code infrastructure.**

Born from 6 months of real-world use managing a complex TypeScript microservices project, this showcase provides the patterns and systems that solved the "skills don't activate automatically" problem and scaled Claude Code for enterprise development.

> **This is NOT a working application** - it's a reference library. Copy what you need into your own projects.

## Quick Start - Pick Your Path

### 🤖 Using Claude Code to Integrate?

**Claude:** Read [`CLAUDE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`](CLAUDE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step integration instructions tailored for AI-assisted setup.

### 🎯 I want skill auto-activation

**The breakthrough feature:** Skills that actually activate when you need them.

**What you need:**
1. The skill-activation hooks (2 files)
2. A skill or two relevant to your work
3. 15 minutes

**👉 [Setup Guide: .claude/hooks/README.md](.claude/hooks/README.md)**

### 📚 I want to add ONE skill

Browse the [skills catalog](.claude/skills/) and copy what you need.

**Available:**
- **backend-dev-guidelines** - Node.js/Express/TypeScript patterns
- **frontend-dev-guidelines** - React/TypeScript/MUI v7 patterns
- **skill-developer** - Meta-skill for creating skills
- **route-tester** - Test authenticated API routes
- **error-tracking** - Sentry integration patterns

**👉 [Skills Guide: .claude/skills/README.md](.claude/skills/README.md)**

### 🤖 I want specialized agents

10 production-tested agents for complex tasks:
- Code architecture review
- Refactoring assistance
- Documentation generation
- Error debugging
- And more...

**👉 [Agents Guide: .claude/agents/README.md](.claude/agents/README.md)**

## What Makes This Different?

### The Auto-Activation Breakthrough

**Problem:** Claude Code skills just sit there. You have to remember to use them.

**Solution:** UserPromptSubmit hook that:
- Analyzes your prompts
- Checks file context
- Automatically suggests relevant skills
- Works via `skill-rules.json` configuration

**Result:** Skills activate when you need them, not when you remember them.

### Production-Tested Patterns

These aren't theoretical examples - they're extracted from:
- ✅ 6 microservices in production
- ✅ 50,000+ lines of TypeScript
- ✅ React frontend with complex data grids
- ✅ Sophisticated workflow engine
- ✅ 6 months of daily Claude Code use

The patterns work because they solved real problems.

### Modular Skills (500-Line Rule)

Large skills hit context limits. The solution:

```
skill-name/
  SKILL.md                  # <500 lines, high-level guide
  resources/
    topic-1.md              # <500 lines each
    topic-2.md
    topic-3.md
```

**Progressive disclosure:** Claude loads main skill first, loads resources only when needed.

## Component Catalog

### 🎨 Skills (5)

| Skill | Lines | Purpose | Best For |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| [**skill-developer**](.claude/skills/skill-developer/) | 426 | Creating and managing skills | Meta-development |
| [**backend-dev-guidelines**](.claude/skills/backend-dev-guidelines/) | 304 | Express/Prisma/Sentry patterns | Backend APIs |
| [**frontend-dev-guidelines**](.claude/skills/frontend-dev-guidelines/) | 398 | React/MUI v7/TypeScript | React frontends |
| [**route-tester**](.claude/skills/route-tester/) | 389 | Testing authenticated routes | API testing |
| [**error-tracking**](.claude/skills/error-tracking/) | ~250 | Sentry integration | Error monitoring |

**All skills follow the modular pattern** - main file + resource files for progressive disclosure.

**👉 [How to integrate skills →](.claude/skills/README.md)**

### 🪝 Hooks (6)

| Hook | Type | Essential? | Customization |
|------|------|-----------|---------------|
| skill-activation-prompt | UserPromptSubmit | ✅ YES | ✅ None needed |
| post-tool-use-tracker | PostToolUse | ✅ YES | ✅ None needed |
| tsc-check | Stop | ⚠️ Optional | ⚠️ Heavy - monorepo only |
| trigger-build-resolver | Stop | ⚠️ Optional | ⚠️ Heavy - monorepo only |
| error-handling-reminder | Stop | ⚠️ Optional | ⚠️ Moderate |
| stop-build-check-enhanced | Stop | ⚠️ Optional | ⚠️ Moderate |

**Start with the two essential hooks** - they enable skill auto-activation and work out of the box.

## Key Concepts

### Hooks + skill-rules.json = Auto-Activation

**The system:**
1. **skill-activation-prompt hook** runs on every user prompt
2. Checks **skill-rules.json** for trigger patterns
3. Suggests relevant skills automatically
4. Skills load only when needed

**This solves the #1 problem** with Claude Code skills: they don't activate on their own.

### Progressive Disclosure (500-Line Rule)

**Problem:** Large skills hit context limits

**Solution:** Modular structure
- Main SKILL.md <500 lines (overview + navigation)
- Resource files <500 lines each (deep dives)
- Claude loads incrementally as needed

**Example:** backend-dev-guidelines has 12 resource files covering routing, controllers, services, repositories, testing, etc.

### Dev Docs Pattern

**Problem:** Context resets lose project context

**Solution:** Three-file structure
- `[task]-plan.md` - Strategic plan
- `[task]-context.md` - Key decisions and files
- `[task]-tasks.md` - Checklist format

**Works with:** `/dev-docs` slash command to generate these automatically

## ⚠️ Important: What Won't Work As-Is

### settings.json
The included `settings.json` is an **example only**:
- Stop hooks reference specific monorepo structure
- Service names (blog-api, etc.) are examples
- MCP servers may not exist in your setup

**To use it:**
1. Extract ONLY UserPromptSubmit and PostToolUse hooks
2. Customize or skip Stop hooks
3. Update MCP server list for your setup

### Blog Domain Examples
Skills use generic blog examples (Post/Comment/User):
- These are **teaching examples**, not requirements
- Patterns work for any domain (e-commerce, SaaS, etc.)
- Adapt the patterns to your business logic

### Hook Directory Structures
Some hooks expect specific structures:
- `tsc-check.sh` expects service directories
- Customize based on YOUR project layout

---

## Integration Workflow

**Recommended approach:**

### Phase 1: Skill Activation (15 min)
1. Copy skill-activation-prompt hook
2. Copy post-tool-use-tracker hook
3. Update settings.json
4. Install hook dependencies

### Phase 2: Add First Skill (10 min)
1. Pick ONE relevant skill
2. Copy skill directory
3. Create/update skill-rules.json
4. Customize path patterns

### Phase 3: Test & Iterate (5 min)
1. Edit a file - skill should activate
2. Ask a question - skill should be suggested
3. Add more skills as needed

### Phase 4: Optional Enhancements
- Add agents you find useful
- Add slash commands
- Customize Stop hooks (advanced)

## Getting Help

### For Users
**Issues with integration?**
1. Check [CLAUDE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](CLAUDE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)
2. Ask Claude: "Why isn't [skill] activating?"
3. Open an issue with your project structure

### For Claude Code
When helping users integrate:
1. **Read CLAUDE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md FIRST**
2. Ask about their project structure
3. Customize, don't blindly copy
4. Verify after integration

### After This Infrastructure

✅ Skills suggest themselves based on context
✅ Hooks trigger skills at the right time
